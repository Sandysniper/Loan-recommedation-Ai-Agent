Interactive Visualizations: (Optional) The application can include interactive charts and graphs to provide a visual representation of loan options and factors influencing loan terms, enhancing user understanding and engagement.


Technical Implementation

CrewAI Framework: The project utilizes the CrewAI framework for building and managing AI agents and tasks.
LLM Integration: A large language model (LLM) is integrated to enable natural language processing and understanding of user inputs and loan information.

Data Sources: The agent accesses and analyzes data from various sources, including loan comparison websites, lender APIs, and financial databases.
